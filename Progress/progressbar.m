% Define the total number of steps in your course
totalSteps = 10; % You can adjust this according to the length of your course

% Initialize the progress bar
h = waitbar(0, 'Progress: 0%');

% Loop through each step of the course
for step = 1:totalSteps
    % Perform the step's task here
    
    % Update the progress bar
    progress = step / totalSteps;
    waitbar(progress, h, sprintf('Progress: %d%%', round(progress*100)));
    
    % Simulate task completion time (replace with your actual tasks)
    pause(1); % Adjust the duration of the pause as needed
    
    % Update the step variable based on the progress of your course
    % For example, if you have a list of tasks and each task completion
    % corresponds to 10% progress, you can update step accordingly
    % For instance:
    % if progress >= 0.1
    %    step = 2;
    % elseif progress >= 0.2
    %    step = 3;
    % and so on...
